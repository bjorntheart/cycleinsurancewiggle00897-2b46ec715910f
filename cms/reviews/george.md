  I had an insurance policy and was told across the board that I may not get the
  money back, despite the fact my bike was stolen by professionals. Wiggle
  handled my case with huge amounts of empathy and kindness. They were friendly
  and lovely the whole way through. With all the things you hear about insurance
  companies, Wiggle defies all the negatives.
