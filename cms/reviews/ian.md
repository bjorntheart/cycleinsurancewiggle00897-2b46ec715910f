  Used the insurance for two or three years and found the customer service
  excellent and the pricing competitive. The proof of course is in claims
  handling. Unfortunately I had the misfortune of having my bike stolen and
  needed to make a claim. The process was slick and with a quick resolution. I
  can't recommend highly enough based on my own experience.
