  A few years ago I came across the wiggle cycle insurance from the wiggle
  website, I considered contents insurance & other forms of insurance for my
  mountain bikes, but none of them were are clearly defined. With wiggle the
  T&C's are summarised so well, it was the obvious choice & two years on, one
  fall caused irreparable damage to my frame and within 48 hours and one
  call-back, it was all sorted. really seamless, efficient & reliable.
