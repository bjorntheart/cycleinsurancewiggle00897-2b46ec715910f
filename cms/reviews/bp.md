  I purchased third party cycle insurance with Wiggle. You hope you never have
  to use it, however in July I was knocked off my bike. The insurance cover
  included a sum for private medical/physiotherapy, which I needed to use.
  Wiggle customer service has been excellent to enable me to access this. From
  the first phone call to my claim I can honestly say I can't fault the
  professional service I received.
