  I originally purchased the insurance because it was a good price and provided
  excellent coverage, and having had good experiences with Wiggle generally I
  figured their insurance should also be a great product. I recently had an
  accident that resulted in a cracked carbon frame, and I could not praise
  Wiggle highly enough for how the claim was managed. I was looked after by
  Conrad de Jongh who was nothing but professional and efficient throughout my
  claim. They were also happy to offer me a cash settlement to the value of the
  repair costs, which means I do not have to live with the slight distrust of a
  repaired carbon frame. All in all, I cannot think of a single way my claim
  could have been handled better, and I could not recommend Wiggle Insurance
  more highly.
