  Excellent, excellent and excellent again. My bike's frame broke and I reached
  out to my insurance. Honestly, I thought I would be a stressful and
  complicated situation but the guys from Wiggle handled it like absolute PROs.
  My policy was managed by Stephan and from start to finish he dealt with me
  like an absolute gentleman. My claim was resolved in one week and I am
  extremely happy with the outcome. I had one bike insured with Wiggle, now I am
  insuring a second one. I can't recommend these guys enough. Keep it up Wiggle!
