  I got insured after a friend of mine accidentally crashed her cargo bike into
  a parked car. She ended up in hospital and also had to pay for all of the
  damage to the BMW - over $2000 in panel work! She wasn't covered because she
  was on a bike. I insured myself in case the same thing happened to me. As it
  turns out, I was lucky as it wasn't an accident that I needed to claim for. My
  bike got stolen from my workplace, lock and all. I was gutted. Anyway, I
  called up Wiggle Insurance, reported it to the police, and a few days later it
  was all sorted and I was paid out. All very smooth and no fuss. I've bought a
  replacement bike and reinsured with Wiggle! Do yourself a favour and sign up
  today.
